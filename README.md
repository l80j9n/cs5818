Submission   Instructions
●   This   assignment   uses   the   same   repository   as   Homework   assignments   4,   5,   and   6,   so   when   you   are   ready   to   start   working   on   Homework   7,   pull   Homework   7   files   from   the   repository   by right-clicking   on   your   Homework   4   project   in   Eclipse   and   selecting   Team      →    Pull   .   .   .    Make sure   that When    pulling   is   set   to   Merge, then   click   Finish.
●   Be   sure   to   commit   and   push   the   files   to   Submitty.    Follow   the   directions   in   the   version   control   handout   for   adding   and   committing   files.
●   Be   sure   to   include   any   additional   files   in   your   repo   using   Team   →   Add   to   Index.
●   Important:   You   must   press   the   Grade   My   Repository   button,   or   your   answers   will   not   be   graded.
IMPORTANT   NOTES:You   should   have   package   hw7 with   the   usual   directory   structure.   Write   your   code   under   src/main/java/hw7   and   your   tests   under   src/test/java/hw7      (shows   as   hw7   under   src/test/java   in   Package   Ex-   plorer).   If your   directory   structure   is   incorrect   autograding   will   fail   resulting   in   a   grade   of 0!
IntroductionYou   will   be   building   a   route-finding   tool.      It   will   take   the   names   or   ids   of   two   buildings   on   the   RPI   Troy   Campus,   and   generate   directions   for   the   shortest   route   between   them,   using   your   graph ADT   to   represent   buildings   and   pathways   between   them.    For   now   you   will   provide   a   simple   text   interface.      In   this   homework,   you   will   write   a   complete   application   runnable   from   the   command   line   via   a   main() method.   You   will   have   to   name   your   main   class   CampusPaths.java   for   testing   on Submitty.In   this   assignment,   you   will   practice   modular   design,   writing   code   for   reuse,   and   design   patterns.   As   before,   you   get   to   choose   what   classes   to   write   and   what   data   and   methods   each   should   have.   Specifically,   you   will   practice   the   model-view-controller   (MVC)   design   pattern.For   organization, this   assignment   contains   one   “problem” for   each   logical   component   you   will   write.   The   order of the problems   is   not   meant to   suggest   an   order   of implementation.    Carefully   design   the   whole   system   before   attempting   to   implement   any   part.    Design   with    “low   coupling”   and   the   “open/closed   principle” in   mind:   you   should   be   able   to   extend   your   system,   while   at   the   same   time the   heart   of your   system   (your   model)   remains   insulated   from   the   changes.   As   always,   you   should   develop   incrementally, which   may   mean   repeatedly writing   a   bit of all   the   parts   and   verifying   that   they   work   together.
Model-View-Controller
You   will   design   your   application   according   to   the   MVC   design   pattern   described   below.   MVC   is   a   variation   of the   Observer   design   pattern   discussed   in   class.As   you   design   and   implement   your   solution,   please   list   which   parts   of   your   code   belong   to   the model,   the   view,   the   controller,   or   none   of   the   above   in   answers/hw7   mvc.pdf.    Often   this   can   be on   a   per-class   level,   but   when   a   class   implements   both   the   view   and   controller,   you   must   indicate   which   methods   or   lines   logically   represent   the   view   and   which   represent   the   controller.    Be   sure   to   list   ALL   classes   you   write   for   Homework   7. This just   should   be   a   list   of classes;   you   don’t   need   to   write   any   sentences   of explanation.
The   Three   Pieces:   Model,   View,   Controller
●   The   model   consists   of the   classes   that   represent   data,   as   well   as   the   classes   that   load,   store,   look   up, or   operate   on   data.    These   classes   know   nothing   about   what   information   is   displayed to   the   user   and   how   it   is   formatted.    Rather,   the   model   exposes   observer   methods   the   view   can   call   to   get   the   information   it   needs.
In   general,   functionality   of   a   model   includes:
–    Reading   data   from   the   data   source   (text   file,   database,   etc.)   to   an   in-memory   represen-   tation.
–    Storing   data   while   the   program   is   running.
–    Providing   methods   for   the   view   to   access   data.
–      Performing   computations   or   operations   involving   the   data   and   returning   the   result.
–   Updating   the   in-memory   state   (if the   application   allows   the   user   to   modify   data).
–   Writing   to   the   data   source   (text   file,   database,   etc.)
●   The   view   implements   the   user   interface.    It   should   store   as   little   data   and   perform   as   little   computation   as   possible;   instead,   it   should   rely   on   the   model   for   data   storage   and   manipula-
tion.   The   view   decides   how   the   user   sees   and   interacts   with   these   data.Does   the   user   interact   with   a   text   interface   or   a   GUI? What   does   the   user   type   and/or   click   to get   directions   from   one   building   to   another?   How   are   those   directions   formatted   for   display?   What   message   does   the   user   see   upon   requesting   directions   to   an   unknown   building?   These   are   questions   the   view   answers.
●   The   controller   listens   to   user   input. Based on   the   user’s   keystrokes,    mouse   clicks,      etc.,   the   controller   determines   their   intentions   and   dispatches   to   the   appropriate   methods   in   the   model   or   view.   For   a   simple   interface   like   in   this   assignment, the   view   and   controller   may   be   somewhat   intermingled   in   code.      Don’t   worry   too   much   about   the   separation   there;   the   key   point   for   now   is   that   the   model   is   cleanly   separated   and   reusable.
Model-View   InteractionIn   general,   avoid   the   temptation   to   create   an   oversized   “god”   class   that   does   everything   for   the model.    The   model   may   contain   multiple   classes,   and   the   view   can   interact   with   multiple   classes in   the   model.   Most   of   the   time,   any   class   that   exists   solely   to   represent   data   is   part   of   the   model.   For   this   assignment,   you   will   likely   choose   to   have   one   central   model   class   that   manages   the   graph   and   does   most   of the   heavy   lifting,   but   you   may   also   want   some   smaller   objects   that   encapsulate   related   data. Some    of   these   objects   might   be   returned   to   the   view   so   it   can   access   their   data   directly,   avoiding   the   “god”   class   scenario;   others   might   only   be   used   internally   within   the   model.Your   model   should   be   completely   independent   of the view   (UI), which   means   it   shouldn’t   know   or   decide   how   data   is   displayed.    The   model   does   know   something   about   what   data   and   operations   the   application   needs,   and   it   should   provide   methods   to   access   them;   however,   it   shouldn’t   return strings   tailored   to   a   particular   view   and   definitely   shouldn’t   contain   printlns.   Imagine   replacing   your   text   UI   with   a   GUI   or   a   Spanish/Mandarin/Klingon   text   UI      (but   with   the   same   English   building   names)   and   ask   yourself:   is   my   model   reusable   with   this   new   view?On   the   flip   side,   the   view   doesn’t   know   anything   about   how   the   model   stores   data   internally.   Someone   writing   a   view   for   your   application   should   only   know   that   the   model   somehow   stores buildings   and   paths   on   campus   and   should   only   interact   with   the   data   at   this   level.    In   other   words,   the   public   interface   of   the   model   should   give   no   indication   that   these   data   are   represented   internally as   a graph.   That   level of detail is   irrelevant   to   the   view,   and   revealing   it   publicly   means   the   model   can   no   longer   change   its   implementation   without   potentially   breaking   view   code.
Problem   1:   Parsing   the   DataWe have added two .csv data files to the data/ directory to be parsed by your application:   RPI   map   data   Nodes   .csv and RPI   map   data   Edges   .csv.   The   .csv files are comma-separated value   files   that   can   be   opened   in   any   text   editor,   just   like   courses   .csv.    Their   format   is   described   in   more   detail   below.
As   usual,   your   program   should   look   for   files   using   filenames   in   your   data/   directory   e.g.,   data/RPI   map   data   Edges   .csv.
You   will   write   a   parser   to   load   the   data   from   these   files   into   memory.   You   may   use   ProfessorParser.java as   a   general   example   of   how   to   read   and   parse   a   file,   keeping   in   mind   that   the   new   data   files   are
structured   differently   from   the   RPI   Courses   data   file.The   file   RPI   map   data   Nodes   .csv   lists   all   buildings   on   campus   along   with   their   pixel   coordinates on   the   campus   map.    The   image   of   the   campus   map   can   be   downloaded here   or   a   larger   version   from here.      File   RPI   map   data   Nodes   .csv   has   two   parts.      The   first   part   lists   all   the   buildings   on   campus,   where   each   line   has   four   comma   separated   fields:
Name,id,x-coordinate,y-coordinate
where   Name   is   the   full   name   of   the   building,   id   is   the   building   id, and   x-coordinate   and   y-coordinate are   the   coordinates   on   the   map.   There   may   be   spaces   in   the   building   names.
The   second   part   of   file   RPI   map   data   Nodes   .csv   shows   the   intersections   on   the   map. The   inter-   sections   have   no   name,   hence   the   name   field   is   empty.
The   file   RPI   map   data   Edges   .csv   lists   pairs   of building   and   intersection   ids: id1 ,id2which   means   that   there   is   a   pathway   between   the   building   or   intersection   denoted   by   id   1    and   the one   denoted   by   id2   .   Pathways   are   bi-directional:   id1   ,id2    means   that   there   is   a   path   from   id1    to   id2   and   also   from   id2    to   id1   .Your   task   is   to   parse   these   two   files   and   build   a   graph   that   represents   the   RPI   campus   map.    For   this   assignment,   you   will   compute   the   length   of a   pathway   from   the   coordinates   of the   end   points   by   applying   the Euclidean   distance   formula.      We   will   be   using   the   convention   that   is   common   in   television   and   computer   graphics   where   the   origin   (the   point   with   coordinates   (0,   0))   is   at   the   top left   corner   of the   campus   map   and   the   positive Y-axis   goes   in   the   downward   direction   as   shown   in   the   picture   below:
   Another   way   of   thinking   about   it   is   imagining   that   your   campus   map   is   in   quadrant   4   of   your   coordinate   plane   instead   of   quadrant   1.      In   particular,   this   means   that   if   you   find   any   common   math   formulas   involving   trigonometric   functions   you   might   have   to   adjust   them   to   the   coordinate   system   used   in   this   assignment   by   inverting   the   signs   of y-axis   parameters.    Otherwise,   you   might   get   your   computations   wrong.
Problem   2:   The   ModelAs   described   above,   the   model   handles   the   data   and   contains   the   major   logic   and   computation   of   your   program.      For   this   assignment,   a   key   function   of   the   model   will   be   finding   the   shortest   route   between   two   building   on   campus.    This   can   be   accomplished   by   using   Dijkstra’s   algorithm to   find   a   shortest   path   in   the   graph,   where   edge   weights   represent   the   pathway   length.   Reuse   the   Dijkstra   method   by   calling   your   Homework   6   code.      Do   not   copy   and   paste   your   Dijkstra   code   from   Homework   6   into   this   homework.   Do   not   re-implement   the   Graph   class   in   your   Homework   7   code.   Reuse   the   Graph   class   from   Homework   4.   Do   not   call   methods   of GraphWrapper   from   your   Homework   7   code,   use   your   Graph   class   directly.      If   you   make   changes   to   code   from   a   previous   homework,   be   aware   that   the   code   must   still   compile.
Problem   3:   The   Controller   and   View
In   this   homework, you   will   write   a   simple   text   interface.   When   the   program   is   launched   through   the main()   method,   it   repeatedly   prompts   the   user   for   one   of the   following   one-character   commands:
●   b   lists   all   buildings   (only   buildings代 写CSCI 2600 — Principles of Software Homework 7: Model-View-ControllerJava
代做程序编程语言) in   the   form   name,id   in   lexicographic   (alphabetical)   order of   name.
● r   prompts the user for the ids or names of   two buildings   (only buildings!)    and prints directions for   the   shortest   route   between   them.
●   q   quits   the   program.    Note:   this   command   should   simply   cause   the   main()   method   to   return.   Calling   System.exit() to terminate the   program   will   break   the   tests.
● m    prints   a   menu   of   all   commands.    Feel   free   to   add   functionality.      Our   tests   cover   only   the   functionality   specified   above.
When   an   unknown   command   is   received   the   program   prints   the   line: Unknown    option
Route   directions   start with:
Path    from      Name      1       to    Name      2 :
where   Name    1    and   Name    2    are   the   full   names   of   the   two   buildings   specified   by   the   user.      Route✚
directions   are   then   printed   with   one   line   per   pathway.    Each   line   is   indented   with   a   single   tab      ()   and   reads:
Walk      direction      to      (Name    3)
where   direction      is   the   direction   of   the   pathway   and   Name      3    is   the      name   of   the   building      at   the pathway   destination.   If the   pathway   destination   is   an   intersection,   print:
Walk      direction      to    (Intersection    id)Direction      should      be      one      of:       North,    NorthEast,    East,    SouthEast,    South,    SouthWest,    West,    or NorthWest.   To   determine the   direction,   compute the   angle of the   destination   from   direction   north   clockwise   (e.g,   angle of 90 degrees is East).    This   angle falls   into   one   of eight   45   degree   circle   sectors   corresponding   to   North,   NorthEast,   East,   etc.   as   shown   in   the   following   diagram:
   
For   example,   if the   angle   is   in   the   sector   [22.5,   67.5),   the   direction   is   NorthEast.
Finally,   print the total   distance   in   pixel   units:   Total      distance:       x      pixel      units   .
where   x   is   the   sum   of   the   (non-rounded)   distances   of   the   individual   route   pathways.
The   total   distance   should   be   rounded   to   three   digits   after   the   decimal   point.    As   in   Homework   6,   we   recommend   the   use   of   format   strings.
Finally,   if one   of the   two   buildings   in   a   route   is   not   in   the   dataset,   the   program   prints   the   line:   Unknown      building:            [Name]
If   neither   building   is   in   the   dataset,   the   program   prints   the   line   twice,   once   for   the   first   building   and   then   for   the   second   one.    If   there   is   no   route   between   two   buildings,   your   program   should   print:
There    is    no    path      from    Name      1      to      Name      2   .To   help   you   with   formatting   your   output   correctly,   we   provide   several   sample   files   described in   the   table   below.      These   files   reflect   the   exact   appearance   of   the   console   window   after   running   the   program,   and   include   both   user   input   and   program   output.      If   you   run   your   program   with   the   user   input   shown   in   the   table,    the   state   of   the   console   should   match   sample   file   contents   exactly   (including   whitespace).   The   sample   files   and   the   descriptions   above,   taken   together,   should completely   specify   the   output   format   of your   program.
Problem   4:   Testing   Your   SolutionUnlike   in   previous   assignments,   the   specification   is   based   solely   on   the   output   of   the   complete   application,   as   invoked   through   the   main()   method.      This   means   that   your   JUnit   tests   will   be   different   from   previous   homework   assignments.We   provide   class   CampusPathsTest.java   as   the   starter   code.    The   runTest()   method   takes   as   a   parameter   the   name   of   the   test   file   and   then   constructs   three   file   names,   one   for   input,   one   for   expected output,   and one   for   actual output.    It temporarily points   System   .in   to   the   input   file   and   System   .out   to   the   actual   output   file   while   it   runs   your   main   program.   The   result   is   that   commands are   read   from   the   input   file   and   output   is   printed   to   the   output   file.    For   your   tests   to   run,   you   simply   need to   add   @Test   methods that   call   runTest() with the   appropriate   argument.    Also, you   might   have   to   edit   the   designated   line   in   runTest()   to   invoke   your main()   method.You will   specify the   commands   for your tests   to   run   in   *   .test   files.    These files   simply   contain   the   input   a   user   would   have   entered   at   the   command   line   as   the   program   was   running.   For   each   test,   a   corresponding    .expected   file   should   contain   the   output   your   program   is   expected   to   print   if   a   user entered that input.    Use   JUnit to run the   tests.    runTest()   compares the   output   in   your    .out   file   against   the   corresponding      .expected   file.Reminder:   if   a   test   fails,   it   is   often   helpful   to   look   at   the    .out   file.    These   files   are   written   to   the   data/   directory.      It   might   be   easier   to   navigate   through   the   file   system   using   your   system’s   file   browser   or   the   terminal,   rather   than   in   Eclipse.
We   have   provided   one   example   test   in   data.   Note   that   the    .expected   file   only   contains   newlines   printed by the program   using   System.out.println().It is important that your test data, i.e.,   *   .test and *.expected files, are   placed   in   directory   data/   and not in directory src/test/java/hw7/.   If   you place your test data under test/ Submitty won’t   grab   the   files   and   will   produce   FileNotFound   Exceptions.Additionally, you   should write   JUnit tests   for every   class   that   is   not   part   of the   view   or   controller.   You may not need to write tests for the view and controller.   One reason is that they should have very   little functionality — they act as glue between   the   UI   (which   is   hard   to   test   programmatically)   and   the   model.   Furthermore, end-to-end   behavior   of   your   application   is   tested   through   the   specification tests.    You   may   write   additional   tests   for   your   view   and   controller   if you   feel   there   are   important   cases   not   covered   by   your   specification   tests,   but   avoid   creating   unnecessary   work   for   yourself   by   duplicating   tests.   You   must   have   at   least   three   different   path   tests.   The   code   instruction/statement coverage   threshold   will   be   set   at   85%   for   this   assignment.

Hints
Best   Coding   Practices
When   designing   classes,   keep   the   single   responsibility   principle   in   mind.   Avoid   huge   “god”   classes.Remember   to   practice   good   procedural   decomposition:    each    method   should   be   short   and   represent   a   single   logical   operation   or   common   task.      In   particular,   it   can   be   tempting   to   implement   your   entire   view   and   controller   as   one   long   method,    but   strive   to   keep   each   method   short   by   factoring   operations   into   small   helper   methods.
Store   your   data   in   appropriate   types/classes.    In   particular,   you   should    not    pack   together   data   into   a   String   and   then   later   parse   the   String   to   extract   the   components.Remember   that   your   graph   should   be   completely   hidden   within   the   model.      Classes   that   depend   on the   model   (namely,   the view   and   controller)   should   have   no   idea that   the   data   is   stored in a graph, not   even   from   the   class   documentation.    If you decided   later to   switch   to   a   different   graph   ADT   or   to   do   away   with   the   graph   altogether   (for   example,   by   making   calls to   the   Google   Maps   API   to   find   paths),   you   want   to   be   able   to   change   the   model   without   affecting   the   view   and   controller,   whose job   has   nothing   to   do   with   how   the   data   is   stored   or   computed.As   usual,   include   an   abstraction   function,   representation   invariant,   and   checkRep()   in   all classes   that   represent   an   ADT.   If   a   class   does   not   represent   an   ADT,   place   a   comment   that   explicitly   says   so   where   the   AF   and   RI   would   normally   go.    For   example,   classes   that   contain   only   class   methods   and   are   never   instantiated   usually   do   not   represent   an   ADT.   You very well   may find that   you   have   more   non-ADT   classes   on   this   assignment   than   in   the   past.   Please   come to   office   hours   if you   feel   unsure   about what   counts   as   an   ADT   and what   doesn’t.
Common   Issues
Do   not   call   System. exit()   to terminate your   program,   as   it will   prevent your   specification   tests   from   passing.If   you   use   Scanner   to   read   user   input   from   System.   in,   be   sure   not   to   call   both   next()   and nextLine()   on   the   same   Scanner   object,   as   the   Scanner   may   misbehave.      In   particular,   some   students   have   found that   it   causes their   programs to work   correctly   at   the   console   but   not   when   they   run   their   tests.   Using   Scanner   is   neither   necessary,   nor   required.Floating-point   precision   and   numeric   comparisons.   If   you   do   arithmetic   over   floating-point values   (float,    double), then   an   exact   == may   not   work   as   expected.   Thus, when   comparing computed floating-point values, you should use an   approximate   comparison,   such   as   that   the   ratio between the values is very close to   1.    However, in this assignment you   may   use   ==   if you   are   comparing   exact   floating-point   values   that   are   read   from   a   file,   without   doing   arithmetic over   them.    Doing   an   approximate   comparison   is   even   wrong,   since   it   would   give   someone   reading   the   code   the   impression   that   you   are   computing   approximate   values.
